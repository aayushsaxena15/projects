projects
========

I am a Computer Science graduate from International Institute of Information Technology, Hyderabad. Currently working on machine learning and artificial intelligence projects.


This is my first official repository meant for reference purposes so that various organizations can go through my work.
I would be happy if some honourable authority could suggest some changes or point out some defects in my work so
that I could improve upon my skills or work.

Thank you.
